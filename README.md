# mst-redux-state-posts

This is a sample basic twitter clone (Tweeeter) written with two different
modern state-management solutions for React (Redux / MST mobx-state-tree). It
aims to show how the same app may be implemented using the two different
technologies, and highlights some differences in their philosophy/how they work.
